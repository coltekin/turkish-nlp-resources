# A list of Turkish NLP resources

This repository contains pointers to
Turkish natural language processing resources,
mainly corpora and tools.

The list is still in its infancy.
It most certainly is not the definitive or an exhaustive list.
If you have suggestions or corrections please contact the maintainers,
or send a pull request.

## Corpora

### Treebanks

- [Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.org/) project
  includes two freely available treebanks.

    - The [UD_Turkish](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Turkish/)
        tree bank has its roots
        in IMST and METU-Sabancı treebanks listed below
        (although content seems to differ).
    - The [UD_Turkish-PUD](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Turkish-PUD/)
        treebank is created as part of the effort in
        [CoNLL 2017 shared task](http://universaldependencies.org/conll17/).

- [GK-treebank](https://github.com/coltekin/gk-treebank) is another
  freely available treebank, following (roughly) UD guidelines.
  The treebank contains annotated sentences from the Turkish grammar by
  [Göksel and Kerslake (2005)](https://books.google.com/books?id=7fXCKZmee8QC).
